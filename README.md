# Digital Clock - Verilog HDL - DE10 FPGA

✨ Key features:
- Design a digital clock circuit that counts minutes and seconds and displays them on HEX3, HEX2, HEX1, HEX0, controlled by the KEY buttons on the DE10 FPGA board, using Verilog HDL.
- KEY0 is used to reset the clock to “00:00”.
- KEY1 is used to start or pause the clock (the clock resumes counting when KEY1 is pressed again).
- A counter and comparator are used to generate an accurate 1 Hz clock pulse from the 50 MHz clock (to achieve precise real-time seconds). This counter can be designed as a separate module and instantiated in the main design.
- The functions for HEX display decoding should also be designed as a separate module.
